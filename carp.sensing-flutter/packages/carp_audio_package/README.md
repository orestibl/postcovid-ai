This library contains a sampling package for connectivity sampling to work with 
the [`carp_mobile_sensing`](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/carp_mobile_sensing) package.
This packages supports sampling of the following [`Measure`](https://pub.dev/documentation/carp_core/latest/carp_core/Measure-class.html) types:

* `dk.cachet.carp.audio`
* `dk.cachet.carp.noise`

See the [wiki]() for further documentation, particularly on available [measure types](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/wiki/A.-Measure-Types)
and [sampling schemas](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/wiki/D.-Sampling-Schemas).

For Flutter plugins for other CARP products, see [CARP Mobile Sensing in Flutter](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter).

If you're interested in writing you own sampling packages for CARP, see the description on
how to [extend](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/wiki/4.-Extending-CARP-Mobile-Sensing) CARP on the wiki.

## Installing

To use this package, add the following to you `pubspc.yaml` file. Note that
this package only works together with `carp_mobile_sensing`.

`````dart
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  carp_core: ^0.20.0
  carp_mobile_sensing: ^0.20.0
  carp_audio_package: ^0.20.0
  ...
`````

### Android Integration

Add the following to your app's `manifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main`:

````xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
````

> **NOTE:** Version 0.5.0 is migrated to AndroidX. This shouldn't result in any functional changes, but it requires any Android apps using this plugin to also 
[migrate](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) if they're using the original support library. 
See Flutter [AndroidX compatibility](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/androidx-compatibility)



### iOS Integration

Add this permission in the `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner`:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Uses the microphone to record ambient noise in the phone's environment.</string>
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
  <array>
  <string>audio</string>
  <string>external-accessory</string>
  <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Using it

To use this package, import it into your app together with the
[`carp_mobile_sensing`](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/carp_mobile_sensing) package:

`````dart
import 'package:carp_core/carp_core.dart';
import 'package:carp_mobile_sensing/carp_mobile_sensing.dart';
import 'package:carp_audio_package/context.dart';
`````

Before creating a study and running it, register this package in the 
[SamplingPackageRegistry](https://pub.dartlang.org/documentation/carp_mobile_sensing/latest/runtime/SamplingPackageRegistry.html).

`````dart
  SamplingPackageRegistry().register(AudioSamplingPackage());
`````

> **NOTE:** The audio and noise probe / measure *cannot* run at the same time, since they both make exclusive use of the microphone.
