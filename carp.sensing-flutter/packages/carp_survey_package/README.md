# CARP Survey Sampling Package

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/carp_survey_package.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/carp_survey_package)

This library contains a sampling package for collecting a survey from the [Research Package](https://www.researchpackage.org) 
collecting the survey answer as part of  
the [`carp_mobile_sensing`](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/carp_mobile_sensing) package.
This packages supports sampling of the following [`Measure`](https://pub.dev/documentation/carp_core/latest/carp_core/Measure-class.html) types:

* `dk.cachet.carp.survey`

See the [wiki]() for further documentation, particularly on available [measure types](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/wiki/A.-Measure-Types)
and [sampling schemas](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/wiki/D.-Sampling-Schemas).
There is **no** privacy protection of data collected from surveys (as part of the default [Privacy Schema](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/wiki/3.-Using-CARP-Mobile-Sensing#privacy-schema)).

For Flutter plugins for other CARP products, see [CARP Mobile Sensing in Flutter](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter).

If you're interested in writing you own sampling packages for CARP, see the description on
how to [extend](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/wiki/4.-Extending-CARP-Mobile-Sensing) CARP on the wiki.
