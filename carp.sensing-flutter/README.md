This repo hold the source code for the [CACHET Research Platform (CARP)](https://carp.cachet.dk) Mobile Sensing (CAMS) Flutter software.
It contains the source code for CACHET first-party (i.e., developed by the core CACHET team) CAMS framework, its packages, and example apps.

In addition, the CARP team maintain a set of [Flutter plugins](https://github.com/cph-cachet/flutter-plugins) (mainly) for sensing purposes. Flutter plugins enable access to platform-specific APIs. For more information
about plugins, and how to use them, see the
[Flutter Packages](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/) description.

These plugins are also available on [pub](https://pub.dev/publishers/cachet.dk/packages).

## Documentation

The overall documentation on the software architecture of CARP Mobile Sensing, and how to use and extend it is available on this github [wiki](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/wiki). Each of the specific packages also contain more specific documentation on how each package is used in the framework (e.g. how the [Firebase data backend package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/carp_firebase_backend) is to be used).
