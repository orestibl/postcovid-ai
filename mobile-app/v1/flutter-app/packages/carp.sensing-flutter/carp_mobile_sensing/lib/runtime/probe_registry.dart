// TODO : change probes to use Dart Isolates in order to support dynamic class loading (and isolation).
// Right now registration of probes has to be done manually.
// Later this will be implemented using Dart Isolates.
// HOWEVER, Dart isolates do not support calling a platform channel method from
// another isolate.
// See issue #13937 >> https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/13937
