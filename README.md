# postcovid-ai
The POSTCOVID-AI project aimed to develop an innovative framework for real-time data acquisition and analysis to monitor the post-COVID-19 context's impact on the well-being of the Spanish population. Through the collection of extensive mobile sensor data and digital questionnaires, the project examined various dimensions of individual and collective well-being, including social, behavioral, and emotional indicators. Leveraging advanced analytical techniques the project generated population forecasting models to anticipate changes in well-being states over time. Key outputs included comprehensive datasets, software tools like the POSTCOVID-AI app and the POSTCOVID-AI population dynamics monitoring dashboard. Despite the diminishing relevance of COVID-19, the project's focus on population well-being remained pertinent, demonstrating resilience and adaptability in addressing broader societal challenges. 

This repository includes the software components and AI models developed during the course of the project.
