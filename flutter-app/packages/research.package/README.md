ResearchPackage is a Flutter [package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/research_package) for building research study apps on Android and iOS using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).

ResearchPackage is a Flutter implementation of the [Apple ResearchKit](https://www.researchandcare.org/researchkit/) available for iOS (just like [ResearchStack](https://github.com/ResearchStack/ResearchStack) is for Android). The overarching goal of ResearchPackage is to enable developers and researchers to design and build cross-platform (iOS and Android) research applications using the same codebase. The API design of ResearchPackage follows the API of ResearchKit almost 1:1 (with a few adaptations to Flutter, including applying more to a reactive programming model). 

ResearchPackage is designed from the ground up to meet the requirements of most scientific research, including capturing participant consent, extensible input tasks, and the security and privacy needs necessary for IRB approval.
The main features of ResearchPackage are:

- [Obtaining informed consent](https://www.researchpackage.org/consent) from participants, including support for a signature.
- [Creating surveys](https://www.researchpackage.org/survey) and questionnaires with a wide range of answer formats (e.g., likert scale, date pickers, image pickers, etc.), such as the [WHO5](https://www.psykiatri-regionh.dk/who-5/Documents/WHO-5%20questionaire%20-%20English.pdf) survey.
- [Supporting localizations](https://pub.dev/documentation/research_package/latest/research_package_ui/RPLocalizations-class.html) of surveys and informed consent.

ResearchPackage is part of the overall [CACHET Research Platform (CARP)](https://carp.cachet.dk) with also provides a Flutter package for mobile and wearable sensing called [CARP Mobile Sensing](https://pub.dev/packages/carp_mobile_sensing). 
The CACHET [Pulmonary Monitor](https://github.com/cph-cachet/pulmonary_monitor_app) app shows how mobile sensing can be combined with collection of survery data from users.

## Documentation

There is a set of tutorials, describing:

- the overall [software architecture](https://www.researchpackage.org/software-architecture) of ResearchPackage
- how to create an [informed consent](https://www.researchpackage.org/consent) flow
- how to define and run [user surveys](https://www.researchpackage.org/survey)

The [ResearchPackage Flutter API](https://pub.dev/documentation/research_package/latest/) is available (and maintained) as part of the package release at pub.dev.

## Example Application

There is an [example app](https://github.com/cph-cachet/research.package/tree/master/example) which demonstrates the different features of ResearchPackage as implemented in a Flutter app.

## Who is backing this project?

Research Package is made by the [Copenhagen Center for Health Technology (CACHET)](https://www.cachet.dk/) and is an important component in the [CACHET Research Platform (CARP)](https://carp.cachet.dk), which is used 
in a number of applications and studies. 
The current project maintainers are [Mads Vedel Saaby Christensen](https://github.com/MadsVSChristensen) and [Jakob E. Bardram](https://www.bardram.net).
