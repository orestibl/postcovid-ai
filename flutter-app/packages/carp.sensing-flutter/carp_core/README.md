This library contains the [CARP core](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.core-kotlin) model as implemented in Dart/Flutter. It contains the domain model for the CARP Mobile Sensing (CAMS) framework and all of its supporting libraries, packages, etc.

This package does nothing on its own. 

* For an overview of all CAMS packages, see [CARP Mobile Sensing in Flutter](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter).
 
* For documentation on how to use CAMS, see the [CAMS wiki](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/wiki).
 
* For a thorough description of the CARP Core domain model, see the [carp.core-kotlin](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.core-kotlin) reprository. The [`example.dart`](example) of this package illustrates how the [Kotlin examples](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.core-kotlin#example) are implemented using Dart.
